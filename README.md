# stack-overview
A whistle-stop tour of a large single page React web app (~August 2015)


### Introduction

Whilst we've seen a lot of presentations talking about specific libraries and features - such as React, gulp and sass - it dawned on us that we've not seen too many talks about what an established frontend stack looks like in practice. So we put this presentation together with the following goals:

- To give new developers an insight into how it all comes together in a production environment.
- To enable established developers to learn from our failures and successes.
- To get feedback from the community as to how we can do things better.

Like all real production environments, our setup is by no means flawless nor does it obey the best practices so do feel free to contribute.
